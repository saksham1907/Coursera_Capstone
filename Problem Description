I am planning to move to California as I got an internship at Tesla Inc. So in order to move I am looking for apartments which are cost efficient and not far away from Tesla factory. For this I applied data science to get all the apartments near Tesla and then filter out apartments that relates to my needs on the basis of distance from the factory, commute methods, nearby groceries and cost & availability of the apartment so it is easy for me to choose the place which fits in best to my needs.

The target audience for this project would be mostly students who get internship at Tesla or some other companies nearby and are looking for economical & cost efficient way of living around it.
