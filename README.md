#Battle of Neighborhoods 
Welcome to my repository where I focused on using data science principles to explore neighborhood data in any particular area and then compared the pros and cons of various neighborhoods in terms of opening a business, relocating for temporary or permanent purpose or anything else. With this you would be able to easily figure out how to segment neighborhoods and filter out the one which is of your keen interest.

As first part of this project I have explored, segmented and clustered neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada. I have made use of unsupervised learning methods such as K means clustering to groupthe data which I acquired by web scrapping and then parsing the HTML code to the pandas dataframe.

After this I havve worked on Capstone project the objective of which is to have a narrowed down list of apartments near Tesla Factory in Fremont, CA for anyone who is willing to relocate their according to the user specific preference. 

Please have a look at the attached reports, presentation and codes for comprehensive understanding of my project.
This repository contains the information of project I did as part of Professional Data Science Specialization on Coursera.
